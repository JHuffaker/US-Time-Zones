# Overview

This Android app that I have called US Time Zones is an extremely simple one. It's purpose is to display all 8 times zones that are in the United States so that the user can easily compare the differences in times between time zones. The app displays the current time of each time zone to the user. I developed this app so that I could learn how to use Android Studio.
